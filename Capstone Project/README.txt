I understand the post put fetch and delete portions of the assignment as well as how to add images and pictures to the setup.

Dropdown boxes and how to organise data and form JSON files and upload/download them into outof servers into a database.

I don't know why I am having issues doing this for the assignment as if I use other structures that do the same thing they don't error like this one is.

Included is the failed project as well as a working version of my DatabaseChecker.html

If you submit data with the bug checker you can use the database checker to view the data as a note looking element. 


I really don't understand what I am doing wrong. And I'm sorry for that...
